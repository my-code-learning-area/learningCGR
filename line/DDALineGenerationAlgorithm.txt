step 1: calculate dx and dy [dx = x2 - x1; dy = y2 - y1]

step 2: calculate steps [steps = |dx| > |dy| ? |dx| : |dy|]

step 3: calculate xincrement and yincrement by using formula [xincrement = dx / steps] [yincrement = dy / steps]

step 4: print pixel and increment x,y by xincrement and yincrement steps times
